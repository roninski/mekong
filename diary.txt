To do:
Check user's Passowrd (Level 0)
Change the login form to request a password & check this is correct.

Display Search results (Level 0)
The starting-point code you've been given display search results as simple text. They should be displayed in a HTML table complete with images.

Interface (Level 0)
Your web site must generate nicely formatted convenient-to-use web pages including appropriate navigation facilities and instructions for naive users. Although this is not a graphic design exercise you should produce pages with a common and somewhat distinctive look-and-feel. You may find CSS useful for this.
Note the model implementation does not meet this requirement and you do not have to match its poor layout & design.
