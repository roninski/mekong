To do:
Check Out (Level 1)
Add buttons and form to allow the user to checkout.

Add/details in Search results(Level 2)
Add buttons to allow users to view the details of any book in their search results and to add any book to their basket.

Drop/details in Basket (Level 2)
Add buttons to allow users to view the details of any book in their basket and to drop (remove) any book to their basket.

Interface (Level 0)
Your web site must generate nicely formatted convenient-to-use web pages including appropriate navigation facilities and instructions for naive users. Although this is not a graphic design exercise you should produce pages with a common and somewhat distinctive look-and-feel. You may find CSS useful for this.
Note the model implementation does not meet this requirement and you do not have to match its poor layout & design.
